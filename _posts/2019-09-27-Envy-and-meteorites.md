title: Envy and meteorites
---

It happens. You were passed over for that promotion, or you just received that professional network update in your inbox. And the first thing that comes to mind is: “That should have been me.”

You know what? You’re probably right. 

Think about your own life, professional and otherwise. How many lucky breaks occurred for you to sit where you are today? What deficiencies did people overlook on your way to your position? How many people are looking at you with envy in their hearts? 

What makes you think the target of your envy is any different?

A vast number of lucky breaks lead you to this current moment; some of those breaks positive, others negative. A chance conversation here, a tragic injury there. A caring mentor at the right time, an indifferent boss on the wrong day. Each of those events had their impact on your thinking and your subsequent actions were shaped by those moments.

How can you overcome envy? Thinking about the rationality of the situation can help, but I’ve never found it visceral enough. We aim to use the tools of skepticism to better practice management, but we cannot ignore human nature. We are riders on the elephant, to quote [Jonathon Haidt, The Righteous Mind]; emotions drive much of our decisions.

I have found the following thought experiment useful for harmonizing the rational and the emotional. Imagine you and your perceived rival were both struck by simultaneous meteorite impacts. The deaths are sudden, unusual and isolated. No one else is harmed, funerals are planned and eulogies written.

Now, think about those funerals, your own and theirs. What things are being said at their funeral that you wished were being said at yours? Take some time, write a list and come back to it.

I hope that your realization will be similar to mine: for the most part, their funeral will talk about their relationships with others and the impact they had on the lives of others. Little time will be paid to the job title. Their salary will go unremarked, and their air miles unmentioned.

However, that person’s imaginary eulogy may include some lines that strike you deeply. “He always knew the right thing to say to cheer me up.” “She never let me down, even when everything was falling apart.” “He was the best father a boy could ever have.”

Those lines are your key to overcoming envy. You can’t control the lucky breaks you’ve already experienced, nor change the ones your rival has endured. You can’t know what challenges and rewards await you in the future. All you can control is how prepared you are to face the next moment that will continue your journey through life.

So find those lines that resonate and even hurt a little, because those are your self improvement clues. Turn the inward facing emotion of envy into a realization that all of us have had lucky breaks in our lives and focus on improving those aspects of our behaviour within our control.

One day, you might even see that meteor heading towards you. Hopefully you’ll say to yourself: I’m gonna have one hell of a funeral.
