title: What is Skeptical Management?
---

I consider myself a member of the modern skeptical community, a loose association of Bigfoot hunters, ghost debunkers, science enthusiasts and vocal atheists. This motley collection of people host occasional conferences, get into massive internet bun fights and publish books, blogs, YouTube videos and podcasts.

While not all the modern skeptical community is worth being involved in, the main thrust of the group is sound: a focus on what scientific processes can tell us about the world. Following from that are a few corollaries:
* An awareness of the psychological biases that impact our ability to make good decisions (or even perceive the world accurately)
* A healthy distrust of authority, especially in light of the above point about biases
* A healthy respect for discussion and debate
* A home for hard-won knowledge about the world (a sort of cultural memory)

When I became a manager, I had already incorporated the skeptical mindset into my daily life; treating the practice of management in a skeptical manner was as natural to me as breathing. However, I quickly learned that the skeptical movement hasn’t penetrated the broader culture as much as I and the community hoped, and some of the thoughts and processes that I took for granted were looked at with suspicion or even scorn.

This blog is my venue to convince those that can be convinced [1] that a skeptical mindset and a management job are complementary, even ideal characteristics. I’m hoping for two outcomes:
1. Existing managers can adopt some of the skeptical mindsets and processes, which hopefully makes them more productive, better able to separate fact from fiction and build an environment that their teams can thrive within; and
1. Aspiring or even reluctant individual contributors can see a path forward from their initial career that doesn’t require them to compromise their values or their soul. It’s true that the art of management is full of compromises, but those times can be treated with respect and with an eye to the Truth (or at least accuracy).

A skeptical manager is humble, aware of her limitations and the limitations of others (her reports, her boss, her boss’ boss, her clients and her competitors), and works to overcome those limits where appropriate. A skeptical manager is constantly learning about the world and about herself. And most importantly, a skeptical manager shares what she’s learned with her peers, building a broader base of understanding for us to further build upon in turn.

Is this a tall order? Does it matter?
